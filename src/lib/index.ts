// Here we put all the external libraries that we use in the project in one place.
// This is a good practice because it makes it easier to manage the dependencies of the project.
// We can also use this file to configure the libraries. For example, we can configure the cors library to allow requests from any origin.
// We can also configure the morgan library to log requests only in development mode.
